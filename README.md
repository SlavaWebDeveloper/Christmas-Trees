## Layout of the [layout](https://www.figma.com/file/ObvvH4JjCuw8gBzYmiLIII/GreenHarvest?type=design&node-id=11069-2&mode=design&t=U3SIUMDgSEvm3O9q-0) "Christmas Trees"

## About the project
The website is structured with HTML for content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements. It includes various sections such as a hero banner, features, tree products, payment options, and a footer with contact information and legal details.

The problems related to the accessibility of the interface have been taken into account.

### Features
#### Garland Animation
A dynamic garland animation has been added to enhance the festive atmosphere on the website. The garland elements change their appearance at regular intervals, creating an engaging visual effect.

#### Snowfall Animation
Snowfall animation adds a seasonal touch to the website. Snowflakes fall from the top of the page to the bottom, creating a winter ambiance.

#### Mobile Navigation
A mobile-friendly navigation menu is implemented. The navigation menu is initially hidden on larger screens and can be toggled open/closed using a burger icon on smaller screens.

#### Order and Consultation Modals
Users can place orders and request consultations through interactive modals. These modals appear when corresponding buttons are clicked, providing a seamless user experience.

#### Countdown Timer
A countdown timer dynamically displays the time remaining until the end of the Christmas tree sale. The timer updates in real-time, keeping users informed about the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
